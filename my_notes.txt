*** How to start it in CLI from root:
pixi run coach-cli --config my_training_config.yaml

First run completed in 35 mins.

*** How to speed it up:
- Use a lighter AI mode/model mapping (e.g., switch to “development” or “cost_effective” in extraction.ai_mode, or remap roles to smaller models in services/ai/ai_settings.py).
- Reduce extraction ranges (fewer days) to shrink summarizer/expert load.
- Set skip_synthesis: true if you only need the plan (saves the synthesis pass).
- Accept that GPT-5.1 is slower; using smaller models (gpt-4o / gpt-4o-mini) is faster/cheaper.

*** In my_training_config.yaml
- activities_days: 21      # How many days of activities to extract
- metrics_days: 56         # How many days of metrics to extract
- ai_mode: "development"   # Overrides .env AI_MODE for coach-cli runs; one of: "development", "standard", "cost_effective"
- enable_plotting: false   # Enable AI-generated plots (default: false to save costs). Set to true for visual insights.
- hitl_enabled: true       # Enable Human-in-the-Loop interactions - agents can ask questions during analysis (default: true)
- skip_synthesis: false    # Skip synthesis and formatter nodes (default: false). Set to true to save tokens when you only need the weekly plan.
- "outside" # Read data directly from race register websites, this is optional

fitnessAge is not used in the code

*** How to use AI_MODE and what does it mean, and DATA RANGES
AI_MODE is defined in my_training_config.yaml and in .env. But can be ignored in .env as long as you start from CLI.

The documentation says that:
development — Fast iterations, cost-effective (7–14 days data)
standard — Comprehensive analysis (21–56 days)

But when using the CLI, you can ***set any combination in YAML*** (e.g., development with 21 days, or standard with 7 days), because defaults are bypassed because the CLI passes explicit values from your YAML.
